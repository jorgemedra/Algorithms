## V0.1 (November 3th, 2017)

- First version with implement the next Algorithms

    1. Stable Matching, using a Stack structure.
    2. Priority Queue, using a Heap Structure that has been developed inhouse. This algorithm had an upgrade to implemente a Priority Queue By Order Min Value or Max Value.
    3. Bread First Search (**BFS**) and Depth First Search (**DFS**) for directed and undirected graphs.
    4. Validate if a undirected graph meets the Bipartiteness propertie, that's meaning that a graph G has no
    odd cycles (The numbers of nodes which comform the cycle are even).
    5. Validate if a directed graph meets the Direct Acyclic Graph (**DAC**) propertie.
